Install python 2.7 or higher

with cmd run with command "python report.py <ProductMasterFile> <SalesFile> <ProductOutputFile>"

ProductMaster csv file and sale list csv can be named anything as long as they are valid csv files.
Program will make ProductReport.csv if it doesn't exist or will override ProductReport.csv if it does.
Then you can run the program with: "python report.py ProductMaster.csv Sales.csv ProductReport.csv".

I included csv files with the example format provided in the assessment.
